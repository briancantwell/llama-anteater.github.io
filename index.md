# Objective

The object of Rival Fight, regardless of the agreed upon team mode, is to defeat your opponent or group of opponents by defeating their fighters in a round of combat. Players begin combat with a Starter, possibly Finishers, and possibly a Rival.

A Team can have a maximum of up to three (3) Hero Characters based on the chosen team mode, and should have at least one (1) Location to represent their home Arena. Players choose the number of characters they wish to use in deck construction.

A player loses when all of his or her Hero Characters have been eliminated from the ring by Knockouts or Wounds, a player’s team pleads No Contest by choosing to give up or submit, or a player loses by a Time Over, in which the player cannot draw a card.

# Types of Cards

## Character Cards and Items

**Hero Character** cards represent the fighters chosen by a player in participation of the tournament and their cards have a deep, burning golden-orange border. There are a multitude of extraordinary fighters with phenomenal powers that will be able to compete in this tournament, but your team can only hold a maximum of three. There can be only one unique copy of any Hero Character card or Hero Level card, or any Unique Item placed in a player’s Battle Deck.

Hero Character cards are unique and have that fighter’s basic information (the fighter’s **name**, its **level**, an **image** of the fighter it represents, and the **team** to which that fighter belongs), vital statistics (**fighting style**, **HP**, and **ability types**), and a **Rival Cost** (which allows you to tag your Starter with a Finisher you control, Level Up the fighter, or to perform the Rival Attack of the Hero). Heroes also are provided with a set of Signature **moves**:  a **Standard Action** (which can be used without spending a card as your combat action) and a **Rival Attack**.

Each **fighter** is assigned to a style, type, or team in which they were entered into the tournament and thus enter the Ring. This in no way limits the possible combinations of characters that a player can use on his or her team other than that there must be at most three Level 1 Characters as chosen Hero fighters. There are advantages to keeping a team together based on ability type or fighting style or associated team, which can be taken advantage of in deck building.

A team could also have **Extras** as Items, which act as specialized fighters “called in” to the fight by the active Hero.

#### Basic Information
<img src="http://rivalfightgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/204-Kev-Monroe-751x1024.jpg" width="40%">

Each fighter has **basic information** that identifies the fighter. The fighter’s **name** determines which cards allow that fighter to gain **levels**. Leveling a fighter up can tremendously add to that character’s fighting ability. A character’s **team** identifies which team that character entered into the tournament with, according to the story. There are some benefits to keeping the characters of a team together. Some cards allow for bonuses or penalties, based on the Hero’s associated team.

All Fighters generally are from one of four **Fighter Classes**: **Striker**, **Grappler**, **Brawler**, and **Tactician**. The fighter’s available class can be found in the lower right corner. In some ways, these classes determine the kinds of moves that are most available to a fighter.

Fighters also have special **Ability Type** categories that are required of a fighter to use certain actions. This can be found in the upper right corner of the card. Fighter **ability types** are categorized as **physical, mental, enigma, arcane, elemental, energy,** or **technology**. Some types have an advantage against others based on how they are capable of affecting the battle.

#### _Fighter Classes and Abilities_

Fighters usually use some form or art of fighting, rather than reckless combat. **Classes** of a fighter include **Striker, Brawler,** **Grappler** or **Tactician**. Strikers use mostly striking attacks in the form of rapid punches and fancy footwork to dispatch an opponent. Brawlers use a balanced amount of strikes and throws. Grapplers usually absorb a lot of damage and return it in the form of holds and throws. Tacticians use other methods to dispatch an opponent other than conventional attacks. A player may group strikers, brawlers, grapplers or tacticians in any combination on a team, and a Hero Character may have multiple fighter classes by leveling up.

The possible **Ability Types** for a fighter are explained as follows:

**P Physical** – actions requiring strength of body, agility, dexterity, and the like. This type has no strength or weakness, as all beings can perform mortal combat using his or her body.

**G Enigma** – actions dealing with the supernatural, preternatural, alien, and just plain weird. This includes the metaphysical, theoretical, mythological, and unexplained.

**E Elemental** – actions that directly use the forces of nature; earth, wind, fire, water, metal, electricity, et al. This is meant in the esoteric sense: the “spirit” or “nature” of a thing.

**N Energy** – actions that directly use the forces of physics in its purest form, kinetic or potential; heat, light, sound, chemical, ions, magnetism, gravity, et al. This is meant in the fundamental scientific nature of a thing.

**T Tech** – actions that require some form or scientific advancement; cybernetics, computers, robots, devices, weapons, et al. This is meant in the use of science to augment or enhance the quality or environment of a thing.

**A Arcane** – actions that call upon esoteric energies, use fortune or occult tactics, or other reality-bending actions outside of physical boundaries. Thesis meant in the impractical, impossible change or alteration of a thing.

**M Mental** – actions that call upon higher mental power, logic, quick thinking, computation and calculation. This could also include multi-dimensional intelligence, polymath capability, ESP, telepathy, telekinesis, astral projection, and so on.

#### _Hit Points and Wounds_

Hero and Extra fighter Characters have **Hit Points**, which determines how much damage they can take before being knocked out and removed from the Ring. A Hero Character can also suffer **wounds**. If a Hero fighter has been wounded ten times, that fighter is knocked out and eliminated.

Once the **Starter** (or active fighter, in the Ring) is **Knocked Out** by having an amount of damage equal to its Hit Points, that character is **replaced** with a fighter from the player’s **Finisher** positions, until all of a player’s Hero Character fighters are completely KO’ed or Wounded.

#### _Hero Character Level System_

Hero Characters may graduate to more powerful levels by placing the next **level** of that fighter next to the previous one. Hero Characters show their level as a number of stars superimposed over the Character symbol. Players cannot level up on their first turn. A Hero Character can only level once in a turn by paying its Rival Cost. Once a Hero Character has graduated to higher levels, the fighter retains all the old moves while new moves are added by new levels.

#### _Fighter Positions_

Each fighter is considered Standing as a base state. In this state, a fighter has three regions in which an attack can land (to the right of the action’s ability type):

*   **HI** – The head, neck, and upper torso. Fighters that are jumping or juggled are exclusively in this region.
*   **MID** – The abdomen and midsection. Most attacks are performed in this region.
*   **LOW** – The legs and feet. Crouching and Prone fighters are considered exclusively in this region.

Note that a fighter can **stand** (base pose), **crouch** or (actively turned sideways and considered out of HI range) be **spent** (actively turned sideways in order to perform and considered **vulnerable**), or **jump** (declare the fighter as ‘in the air’ or **airborne** and upside-down to the playerand out of LOW range) as possible positions.

Conversely, a fighter can also be made to go into negative states: **juggled** (as in ‘popped-up into the air’ or **airborne** and unable to defend the next attack), **prone** (fighters made to go prone cannot defend the next attack and are put in the **down** position), become **stunned** (stunned fighters are unable to defend the next attack) or made **vulnerable** (vulnerable fighters are unable to defend or counter until your next stand phase), be **wounded** (with ten wounds causing a KO) or be **confused** (forced to flip a coin for success or fail their next attack).

#### _The Fighting Meter_

The availability of some cards to be used by a player will be determined by that player’s **Fighting Meter**. The Fighting Meter serves to act as the team’s collective fighting power. Some actions have a **Meter Effect** in which the player’s Fighting Meter will **Gain** or **Burn** points. A player has a maximum of ten points available in the Fighting Meter. An action’s Meter Effect is shown at the bottom of a maneuver’s ability type. The player’s Fighting Meter is to be used across all fighters on a player’s team (there is still only one meter for a team of multiple fighters).

#### _Standard Actions_

Each Hero character card has a **Standard Action** written on it that can be used during your combat phase. Only your Starter’s Standard Actions can be used during your combat phase without using a card. A player can only use one Standard Action of a level of a fighter once per turn, and it counts as playing an action for the turn. Standard Actions can only be played on your turn, during your combat phase.

#### _The Rival Attack and Power_

**Rival Powers** are a passive effect that some Hero or Extra Characters have which aid them in battle. These usually happen as static or triggered abilities during the flow of combat. These abilities are always active as long as that fighter is your Starter, or in the Ring.

**Rival Attacks** are Special attacks that can be used by paying that fighter’s **Rival Cost**. The Rival Attack of a Starter or Rival can only be used once in a turn on a card. A Rival teammate (in Rival teams) may use this action in this manner to ‘jump in’ and help your Starter during combat, offensively and defensively, without costing your player combat action.

#### _Character Items and Extras_

**Items** are external forces that affect the flow of battle. Items will have a cost dependent on a player’s team, class, ability type, or Fighting Meter. Important **objects** and character **props** can aid the team once thrown in the Ring. Intervening **extras** (other fighter characters that are not unique) in the arena can aid the fighter in combat. Items sometimes use fighter information, a condition, or the board state to determine the legality of that fighter using such an item in combat. Items affect gameplay through the text on the card. They also have an orange border, like Character cards.

**Objects** enter the ring and remain until they are removed from the ring or eliminated. Some have an ongoing effect until they leave the ring.  Others have activated or triggered abilities that help affect the flow of combat.
<img src="http://rivalfightgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/331-Whip-751x1024.jpg" width="40%">

**Props** are ‘thrown into the Ring’ and must be ‘picked up’ the turn after they enter the ring or are dropped. Props are thrown in or ‘picked up’ by spending Fighting Meter. An item that is ‘picked up’ by a fighter is considered as equipped or attached to that fighter. A fighter may ‘drop’ an item or ‘pick up’ another as a non-standard action. Items are ‘picked up’ for their Meter Burn cost.

**Extras** are fighter characters that are called upon by the active fighter, your Starter. Extras may act the turn they enter the ring, and may act only once per turn. Some extras require Fighting Meter, fighter styles or types in order to enter the ring. Extras have HP and must be knocked out to be removed from the Ring. Some have an ongoing effect until they leave the ring.  Others have activated or triggered abilities that help affect the flow of combat and may Gain or Burn Meter, Spend or Exhaust themselves to perform actions.

## Location Cards

<img src="http://rivalfightgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/144-The-Basement-1024x744.jpg" width="40%">


**Location** cards represent the Arenas in which the fighters choose to duel. Locations are set in the Rival Fight world, using fictional places based in the real world. These cards have a deep green background and are oriented in landscape format. Locations may alter game-play through the effect text. Locations also use fighter information like fighting style or team to determine if its effects are in place or not. Fighters start in the Street, a nondescript location. Locations are played by paying Meter Burn and replace the previous one when played. Locations are discarded when a new one enters play.

## Combat Cards

Combat cards are the bulk of the Battle Deck and serve four purposes: to **attack**, **defend**, **counter** or **maneuver**. In combat, cards enter the **Action String**, or the sequence of moves performed by the combating fighters. Some combat cards require a particular fighter, a class, or team, or other qualifier to be used by the Starter in the Ring. Combat cards also have a **range**, HI, MID, or LOW, representing the vertical fighting element. A combat card could also affect a player’s **Fighting Meter**. Each card played from a player’s hand is considered an **action**. Only one offensive combat card can be played as your Starter’s action during your combat phase, if you have not played a Hero Character’s Standard Action this turn. A player may play any legal **Defense** card.

### Offensive Cards

<img src="http://rivalfightgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/005-Snap-Punch-751x1024.jpg" width="40%">


**Attacks** inflict damage in combat. These are the most commonly used cards in combat, and can create ‘Action Strings’ of cards being played. These cards, used to deal damage to a target or otherwise act offensively in the battle, can be used by any fighter that fits its criteria. Attacks may only be played on your turn during your combat phase, and have a violent red background. They are a Strike (the fighter is trying to hit you with a punch or kick), Grapple (the fighter is trying to grab or throw the opponent), or some Special attack or Maneuver (some attack or maneuver that constitutes the use of another one of your extremities, or an outside force).

#### _Punches and Kicks_

Punches and kicks constitute the bread and butter of the Striker and Brawler’s repertoire. They are quick attacks intended to allow several hits or disorient the opponent.

#### _Grapples and Throws_

Grapples tend to create an undesirable state over time (as in locks and holds). Throws tend to reorient the opponent in the ring. These are used mostly by Grapplers and Tacticians.

### Maneuvers

**Maneuvers** are any other action that would not count as a direct attack or defense. Some maneuvers create beneficial effects which could change the flow of the game.

### Defensive Cards
<img src="http://rivalfightgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/039-Standing-Defense-751x1024.jpg" width="40%">



Every good offense should have a good defense. Defensive cards consist of Defenses (actually blocking or defending an oncoming attack) and Counters (cards that allow the defender to end the action string by countering the move).

Defense cards serve the purpose of being added defense for your fighter when trying to punish, mitigate, block or absorb damage. Defense cards may be played at any time during the combat phase and have a strong, blue background. Some fighters use defensive counters or grapples to lock or stun the opposing Starter, or to repel attack, and may burn Fighting Meter.

#### _Defenses_

**Defense** cards prevent damage and avoid blows. These cards do not end the combo string, but are capable of mitigating or punishing damage. Most defenses have an added benefit for blocking, such as adding more to the **Fighting Meter**.

#### _Parrys and Counters_

Cards with **Parry** allow the defensive fighter to act during the Action String. **Counters** end the combo string. Ending the combo string means that the current combo string is now over, and that no other combat actions can be taken by that fighter during the current combat phase.

### Signature Moves

<img src="http://rivalfightgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/256-Weiss-Buster-751x1024.jpg" width="40%">

Signature Moves represent the fighter’s special, intuitive or trained techniques in combat, such as inner strength attacks, special throws and attack combinations. Signature Moves may be a **Special**, **Super** or **Supreme** Move, which greatly affect the game. Signature Moves can be used by any player that applies to the information sections of the card, and generally cost Fighting Meter. Supreme Moves can deal massive damage, so be careful, but be ready.

## **Event and Effect Cards**

Events and effects are non-combat cards that can affect the flow of battle.

#### _Events_

<img src="http://rivalfightgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/078-Ring-of-Fire-751x1024.jpg" width="40%">


Event cards are lasting effects that remain on the field until removed from the ring and have a black background. Events can only be played on your turn and can be played by a player who has a Starter in the Ring with the right ability type. Some Events or Event effects cost Fighting Meter. Some take effect immediately. Events do not leave the ring at the end of your turn.

#### _Effects_


<img src="http://rivalfightgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/124-Masters-Concentration-751x1024.jpg" width="40%">


**Effect** cards are instant tricks that alter game-play. Effects can be played at any time and have a black background. Some Effects may depend on a Starter of a particular class or ability, and may affect the Fighting Meter. They are resolved instantly, and in turn are discarded immediately after use.
